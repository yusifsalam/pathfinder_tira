# Week 1

## What was done

This week was spent on getting the project started. This included thinking about the potential topics of the project, the technology stack, the features as well as the implementation plan for the said features.

## The progress

There is no concrete code at this point. A github repository has been created to host the project and the first version of the specification document has been now written. Documentation is in early stages.

## Learning outcomes

So far none.

## Problems

The course homepage is quite a pain to navigate about. It was rather challenging to pick a topic for the project, as that requires a compromise between the complexity and the available time. As such, I decided to go with a project that may not be as interesting but something that I can implement without spending too many hours.

## Next

Next week I will start working on the code and try to implement one of the simpler algorithms.
