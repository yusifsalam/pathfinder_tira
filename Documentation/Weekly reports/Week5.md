# Week 5

## What was done

This week I refactored some bad code that I wrote earlier.

## The progress

Not too much progress in terms of the actual program functionality. Two heuristic functions were implemented - they are Manhattan and Octile.

## Learning outcomes

Learned something about heuristic functions.

## Problems

Lack of time.

## Next

Next I will finish the A-star algorithm implementation and start working on JPS.
